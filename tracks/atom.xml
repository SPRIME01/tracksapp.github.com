    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Tracks 2.1.4 is released. This release addresses another security vulnerability in Rails. You can download it <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/archive/v2.1.4.zip">here</a>. All changes can be seen <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4">here</a>. Upgrade instructions can be found in the manual.</p>

<p>I hope this is the last 2.1.x release and that the next release will be Tracks 2.2 containing a lot of improvements. You are welcome to help test Tracks 2.2. In the mean time if you prefer the stable release, 2.1.4 is the best choice.</p>

<p>Please note that Tracks 2.1.x does not support ruby 1.9 and it depends on ruby 1.8.7. Tracks 2.2 will support both ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9. After 2.2 support for ruby 1.8.7 will be dropped.</p>

<p>It is finally done! You can now [download]<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Tracks version 2.1 from github.<br />
We did our best to test this new version well, but any problems you may have<br />
can be posted to [Assembla]<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Improvements for translations are welcome<br />
too.</p>
<p>Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0 or from<br />
2.1RC1. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run<br />
<code>bundle install</code> (instead of <code>rake gems:install</code>). If you use passenger and<br />
the gems will not load using bundler, set the <code>BUNDLER_PATH</code> in<br />
<code>.bundler/config</code>. See the installation and upgrade manual for more details.</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of new contributions from several contributers: Ignacio<br />
Ihuerta, Christof Spies, Stefan Richter, Mickey Reiss, Demian Gemperli, Matt<br />
Rogers, Jan Stępień, Antonin Blanc, Christian Frank, Sebastian Fischmeister,<br />
Andreas Brandl, Craig Maloney, Pavel Zupa, Tim Madden, Jaime Hernandez,<br />
Damian Shalev. Also we have two new committing developers (Hi Matt Rogers<br />
and Stefan Richter) to keep development of Tracks going.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you!!</p>
<p>The current release is based on rails 2.3 and only supports ruby 1.8.7. This<br />
infrastructure is getting outdated. For release 2.2 we will upgrade this to<br />
rails 3 and support ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.3.</p>
<p>This release brings a lot of new goodies:</p>
<p>New and changed features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of the completed todos: a new overview page. Also all context<br />
and  project pages have a link to their completed actions<br />
2. New locales (es by Ignacio Ihuerta, fr by Antonin Blanc, cz by Pavel Zupa<br />
and he by Damian Shalev) and updated locales (de, nl)<br />
3. You can star an action right from the form for adding a new action<br />
4. Redesign of preferences page<br />
5. You can now mark an action complete from the tickler<br />
6. Project names can now contain comma (&#8216;,&#8217;) in it name<br />
7. Context view now shows hidden and pending actions<br />
8. Mobile improvements (we now require some javascript support on the<br />
mobile)<br />
9. Two extra defer periods in the context menu of an action<br />
10.There is a review page where you can see stalled or neglected projects.<br />
There is a reviewed button on the project edit page to mark a project<br />
reviewed.<br />
11.You need to change your password: migrated to better BCrypt hash algoritm<br />
for storing passwords</p>
<p>New features (technical)</p>
<p>1. There are two example ruby scripts in /doc to use the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> to add a<br />
todo or a project template with todos from the command line<br />
2. The tag page can now select actions from mulitple tags using <span class="caps">AND</span> and OR.<br />
There is no gui for this. Syntax is /todos/tag/tagA,tagB?and=tagC to select<br />
all todos with (tagA or tagB) <span class="caps">AND</span> tagC</p>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<p>1. Upgraded rails to 2.3.12, jquery to 1.7.1 and jquery-ui to 1.8.17<br />
2. Fixed several issues with the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span><br />
3. Upgraded the act_as_statemachine plugin. This change requires a<br />
migration. See note above!<br />
4. Migated to bundler for gem dependencies<br />
5. Migrated to cucumber and capybara for integration testing<br />
6. Development mode shows a work-in-progress banner on top of the screen</p>

<p>It is finally release candidate time! You can now <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.1RC1">download</a> Tracks version 2.1 RC1 from github. Please try it out to see if you think it is ready for public release. Any problems you have can be posted to <a href="www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/">Assembla</a>. Improvements for translations are welcome too.</p>

<p>I will update the installation and upgrade manual soon. I am talking to BSAG to find out how to do this on getontracks.org after the migration of the site to github. In general, you can follow the upgrade manual. Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run &#8220;bundle install&#8221; (instead of rake gems:install). If you use passenger and the gems will not load using bundler, set the BUNDLER_PATH in .bundler/config.</p>

<p>For developers: to get to the stable 2.1 release, I&#8217;ve branched master into 2.1_branch. Development can continue in the master branch.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-04T16:54:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/handing-over-the-keys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have been following posts on the mailing list and on this site, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;ve been in the process of handing the Tracks project on for others in the community to take over. That day has come much closer now because I have finally finished the process of adapting the old site to be published on GitHub (using the excellent <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>). It has taken a bit of time to get right, and there may be a few glitches here and there while the DNS propagates, but things should be working. Most of the site is how it was, except that the forum is now read only, as an archive of useful information. Some of the links in the forum may be broken (for example the search facility and member profiles) in the process of generating a static version, but the basic information should still be available.</p>

<p>In due course I&#8217;ll transfer the domain name to someone else in the Tracks community, transfer the balance of the Pledgie donations, and I&#8217;ll have handed all the keys over.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity for thanking all the Tracks users for their support over the years. Tracks is in great hands, and I&#8217;m sure it will continue from strength to strength in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>

<p>A message from Reinier Balt, who has worked incredibly hard on this release. Congratulations to him and to all the other contributors!</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After way too long time (1.7 was released on 28 feb 2009!) we are finally releasing Tracks 2.0. I&#8217;m hoping to shorten the release cycle in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Important for upgrade is that the requirements for running Tracks have changed (ruby 1.8.7 / rubgems ~1.5.0). Also be aware when upgrading from a recent development version or RC version to delete the caches stylesheets and javascripts from your install. The updated installation manual can be found on github and on the Tracks website, also containing the details of the changed requirements and deleting the cached files from your previous install.</p>
<p>Please note that xuinkrbin has started a <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Users-Manual">user manual</a> on the wiki. Anyone like to help out and write some stuff about setting up and using Tracks? A user manual if often asked for.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into Tracks 2.0 and we have seen quite a few new (and old :-) ) contributors helping out with patches and github pull requests. Thanks to you all!</p>
<p>Now, onto the details of this release.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of menus and introduction of a context menu per todo<br />
2. You can now set the default tags for a project which are added automatically to a new action in that project if no tags are supplied<br />
3. Tracks now includes support of dependencies. Making an action dependent on another action will hide it until the dependency is completed<br />
4. you can now drag an action from one context to another<br />
5. Support for entering multiple actions in one form<br />
6. You can now promote an action to a project<br />
7. It is easier to view notes on the mobile interface and other interface fixes<br />
8. The project description supports markup<br />
9. support for Mail.app (message://) and OneNote (onenote://) links in notes<br />
10.The email receiver is now able to receive email from several email adresses.  In site.yml this could be set to the previous behavior (receive from one address per user)<br />
11.You can enable open signup (like in tracks.tra.in) <br />
12.Cleanup of context page<br />
13.Support for <span class="caps">CAS</span> for login<br />
14.Support for adding Tracks as a GMail Widget with instructions on the Integrations page<br />
15.Tracks now support internationalization. First translations are German and Dutch. See http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Translating-Tracks it you like to help translating Tracks to other languages. Please report any errors in translations to our bug tracker at Assembla!</p>
<p>Under the hood</p>
<p>1. All js is migrated to jQuery and most ui-widgets are migrated to jQuery-UI<br />
2. Cucumber is added for integration testing. The RSpec stories are migrated to cucumber, so are most selenium scripts<br />
3. Upgraded to rails 2.3.11 and upgraded most gems/plugins<br />
3. Bugfixes (lots of them)</p>]]></content>
