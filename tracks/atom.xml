<p>Tracks 2.2 is being released today with a variety of new features and bugfixes! You can download the release <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/archive/v2.2.zip">here</a>. Upgrade instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/v2.2.2/doc/upgrading.textile">in the manual</a></p>
<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added caching to various parts of Tracks to speed things up</li>
	<li>Better support for running Tracks with PostgreSQL</li>
	<li>Improvements to the mobile interface.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop should work on tablets</li>
	<li>Upgrade to the latest stable version of Rails. This brings in some changes like new command to start Tracks and precompiling assets. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/v2.2.2/doc/installation.textile">installation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/v2.2.2/doc/upgrading.textile">upgrade manual</a> for details.</li>
	<li>Tracks now includes support for Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9. The next version of Tracks will only support Ruby 1.9. Support for<br />
older versions of Ruby will then be dropped.</li>
	<li>Tons of bugfixes, updated locales and other improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed in this release:</p>
<ul>

	<li>Support for the <span class="caps">SOAP</span> <span class="caps">API</span>. The <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> should be used instead. This may impact your scripts or mobile apps that<br />
integrate with Tracks using <span class="caps">SOAP</span> <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="caps">API</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of contributrions by various people from our community have found their way into this release. This release also sees the addition of a new member to the Tracks team. Please welcome Dan Rice as a new committer! Dan has been instrumental in improving our support for PostgreSQL and making a ton of other small improvements to the Tracks codebase for this release.</p>

<p>It is finally done! You can now [download]<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Tracks version 2.1 from github.<br />
We did our best to test this new version well, but any problems you may have<br />
can be posted to [Assembla]<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Improvements for translations are welcome<br />
too.</p>
<p>Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0 or from<br />
2.1RC1. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run<br />
<code>bundle install</code> (instead of <code>rake gems:install</code>). If you use passenger and<br />
the gems will not load using bundler, set the <code>BUNDLER_PATH</code> in<br />
<code>.bundler/config</code>. See the installation and upgrade manual for more details.</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of new contributions from several contributers: Ignacio<br />
Ihuerta, Christof Spies, Stefan Richter, Mickey Reiss, Demian Gemperli, Matt<br />
Rogers, Jan Stępień, Antonin Blanc, Christian Frank, Sebastian Fischmeister,<br />
Andreas Brandl, Craig Maloney, Pavel Zupa, Tim Madden, Jaime Hernandez,<br />
Damian Shalev. Also we have two new committing developers (Hi Matt Rogers<br />
and Stefan Richter) to keep development of Tracks going.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you!!</p>
<p>The current release is based on rails 2.3 and only supports ruby 1.8.7. This<br />
infrastructure is getting outdated. For release 2.2 we will upgrade this to<br />
rails 3 and support ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.3.</p>
<p>This release brings a lot of new goodies:</p>
<p>New and changed features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of the completed todos: a new overview page. Also all context<br />
and  project pages have a link to their completed actions<br />
2. New locales (es by Ignacio Ihuerta, fr by Antonin Blanc, cz by Pavel Zupa<br />
and he by Damian Shalev) and updated locales (de, nl)<br />
3. You can star an action right from the form for adding a new action<br />
4. Redesign of preferences page<br />
5. You can now mark an action complete from the tickler<br />
6. Project names can now contain comma (&#8216;,&#8217;) in it name<br />
7. Context view now shows hidden and pending actions<br />
8. Mobile improvements (we now require some javascript support on the<br />
mobile)<br />
9. Two extra defer periods in the context menu of an action<br />
10.There is a review page where you can see stalled or neglected projects.<br />
There is a reviewed button on the project edit page to mark a project<br />
reviewed.<br />
11.You need to change your password: migrated to better BCrypt hash algoritm<br />
for storing passwords</p>
<p>New features (technical)</p>
<p>1. There are two example ruby scripts in /doc to use the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> to add a<br />
todo or a project template with todos from the command line<br />
2. The tag page can now select actions from mulitple tags using <span class="caps">AND</span> and OR.<br />
There is no gui for this. Syntax is /todos/tag/tagA,tagB?and=tagC to select<br />
all todos with (tagA or tagB) <span class="caps">AND</span> tagC</p>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<p>1. Upgraded rails to 2.3.12, jquery to 1.7.1 and jquery-ui to 1.8.17<br />
2. Fixed several issues with the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span><br />
3. Upgraded the act_as_statemachine plugin. This change requires a<br />
migration. See note above!<br />
4. Migated to bundler for gem dependencies<br />
5. Migrated to cucumber and capybara for integration testing<br />
6. Development mode shows a work-in-progress banner on top of the screen</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>It is finally release candidate time! You can now <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.1RC1">download</a> Tracks version 2.1 RC1 from github. Please try it out to see if you think it is ready for public release. Any problems you have can be posted to <a href="www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/">Assembla</a>. Improvements for translations are welcome too.</p>

<p>I will update the installation and upgrade manual soon. I am talking to BSAG to find out how to do this on getontracks.org after the migration of the site to github. In general, you can follow the upgrade manual. Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run &#8220;bundle install&#8221; (instead of rake gems:install). If you use passenger and the gems will not load using bundler, set the BUNDLER_PATH in .bundler/config.</p>

<p>We have seen a lot of new contributions from several contributers: Ignacio Ihuerta, Christof Spies, Stefan Richter, Mickey Reiss, Demian Gemperli, Matt Rogers, Jan Stępień, Antonin Blanc, Christian Frank, Sebastian Fischmeister, Andreas Brandl, Craig Maloney, Pavel Zupa, Tim Madden, Jaime Hernandez</p>

<p>Also we have two new committing developers (Hi Matt Rogers and Stefan Richter) to keep development of Tracks going. Thanks to all of you!!</p>

<p>For developers: to get to the stable 2.1 release, I&#8217;ve branched master into 2.1_branch. Development can continue in the master branch.</p>

<p>This release brings a lot of new goodies:</p>

<p>New and changed features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Redesign of the completed todos: a new overview page. Also all context and project pages have a link to their completed actions</li>
<li>New locales (es by Ignacio Ihuerta, fr by Antonin Blanc, cz by Pavel Zupa) and updated locales (de, nl)</li>
<li>You can star an action right from the form for adding a new action</li>
<li>Redesign of preferences page</li>
<li>You can now mark an action complete from the tickler</li>
<li>Project names can now contain comma (&#8216;,&#8217;) in it name</li>
<li>Context view now shows hidden and pending actions</li>
<li>Mobile improvements (we now require some javascript support on the mobile)</li>
<li>Two extra defer periods in the context menu of an action
10.There is a review page where you can see stalled or neglected projects. There is a reviewed button on the project edit page.
11.You need to change your password: migrated to better BCrypt hash algoritm for storing passwords</li>
</ol>


<p>New features (technical)</p>

<ol>
<li>There are two example ruby scripts in /doc to use the REST API to add a todo or a project template with todos from the command line</li>
<li>The tag page can now select actions from mulitple tags using AND and OR. There is no gui for this. Syntax is /todos/tag/tagA,tagB?and=tagC to select all todos with (tagA or tagB) AND tagC</li>
</ol>


<p>Under the hood:</p>

<ol>
<li>Upgraded rails to 2.3.12, jquery to 1.7.1 and jquery-ui to 1.8.17</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with the REST API</li>
<li>Upgraded the act_as_statemachine plugin. This change requires a migration. See note above!</li>
<li>Migated to bundler for gem dependencies</li>
<li>Migrated to cucumber and capybara for integration testing</li>
<li>Development mode shows a work-in-progress banner on top of the screen</li>
</ol>

    <updated>2012-01-04T16:54:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/handing-over-the-keys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have been following posts on the mailing list and on this site, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;ve been in the process of handing the Tracks project on for others in the community to take over. That day has come much closer now because I have finally finished the process of adapting the old site to be published on GitHub (using the excellent <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>). It has taken a bit of time to get right, and there may be a few glitches here and there while the DNS propagates, but things should be working. Most of the site is how it was, except that the forum is now read only, as an archive of useful information. Some of the links in the forum may be broken (for example the search facility and member profiles) in the process of generating a static version, but the basic information should still be available.</p>

<p>In due course I&#8217;ll transfer the domain name to someone else in the Tracks community, transfer the balance of the Pledgie donations, and I&#8217;ll have handed all the keys over.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity for thanking all the Tracks users for their support over the years. Tracks is in great hands, and I&#8217;m sure it will continue from strength to strength in the future.</p>

    <updated>2011-07-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/the-wiki-has-moved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>
