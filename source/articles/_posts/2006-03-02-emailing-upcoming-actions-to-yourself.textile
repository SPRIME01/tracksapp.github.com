"Luke Melia":http://www.lukemelia.com/ came up with an absolute gem of a tip on the "tracks-discuss":http://rousette.org.uk/projects/news/33/tracks-discuss-mailing-list mailing list. If you enter the following command in your crontab on the server which runs your copy of Tracks 1.04, it will email you a list of the upcoming actions which are due within the next 7 days every day at 6 am (the command should be on one line, without the backslashes):

<pre>
<code>
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/curl -0 http://[tracks_url]/feed/text/[username]/[your_token]?due=6 | /usr/bin/mail -E -s 'Tracks actions due in the next 7 days' youremail@yourdomain.com
</code>
</pre>

It's easiest if you copy and paste the URL of the text feed from your feeds page. Of course you can choose any feed you like &mdash; why not email a list of next actions in a particular project to a group of colleagues who are working on the project?
