If you're cloning or forking Tracks from "GitHub":http://github.com/bsag/tracks/, you might be interested in some changes you can make to your .bashrc to make using git a bit more comfortable. Henrik over at The Pug Automatic posted "this tip":http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt for putting both your current branch name on the command line, and also indicating whether you have any uncommitted changes in the branch. If your branch has uncommitted changes, it prints an asterisk after the branch name. This is incredibly helpful for seeing at a glance what state you are in, without having to issue the commands 'git branch' or 'git status'. If you flit about between branches a lot, having the branch name at the command prompt can save you from a great deal of trouble.

You can grab Henrik's code "here":http://gist.github.com/31631, or use mine below. I just foraged around among the forks and the comments on "this related post":http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/ to get a version combining the best bits of them all, then I substituted in my existing command prompt. Enjoy!
