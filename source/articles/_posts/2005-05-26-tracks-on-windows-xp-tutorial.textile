John Leonard has written up a "fantastic tutorial":http://www.jjleonard.co.uk/?p=102 for getting Tracks running on Windows XP, including using a package called "Uniform Server":http://www.uniformserver.com/ which provides  a web server and MySQL among other things. There's also a full "video tutorial":http://www.jjleonard.co.uk/tracks/tracksinstall.html with notes to make the whole process crystal clear.

Yay John! I love it when users help other users out.

*Updated 25/10/2005* to link to John's new and updated version of the tutorial that works with Tracks 1.03.
