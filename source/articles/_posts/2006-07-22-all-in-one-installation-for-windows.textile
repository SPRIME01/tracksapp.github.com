For those of you on Windows who have been struggling with getting Tracks installed, Jim Strupp has kindly "packaged up an installation":http://www.4shared.com/dir/950576/3127bee6/Tracks4Win.html of Tracks which uses Uniform Server. Everything you need (except Ruby) is included, and it's a simple double click on a batch file to start Tracks running. Give it a go! And many thanks to Jim for creating and hosting the package.

*Updated 29-09-2006*: Fixed the link to the installation.
