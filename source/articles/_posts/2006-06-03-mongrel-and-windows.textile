mk sent me the following tip for people wanting to running Tracks on Windows using Mongrel as the webserver, rather than WEBrick, Apache or lighttpd:

Installing mongrel (this would work for Linux and MacOS X users too):

<pre>
<code>
sudo gem install mongrel
cd tracks_directory
mongrel_rails start -d
</code>
</pre>

Running the service:

<pre>
<code>
mongrel_rails_service install -n tracks -r c:\path\to\tracks -p 4000 -e production
mongrel_rails_service start -n tracks
</code>
</pre>

Now hit the port and poof, it works (or should). The application will stop if you use:

<pre>
<code>
mongrel_rails_service stop -n tracks
</code>
</pre>

Off course, you can control service at services in the control panel. I have it set to start on boot, and that's it. Read more about <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> or more about <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/docs/win32.html">Mongrel on Windows</a>.
