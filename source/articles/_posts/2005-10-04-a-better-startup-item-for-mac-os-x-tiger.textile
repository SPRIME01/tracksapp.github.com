Jeroen van der Ham has been hard at work improving the "method for starting Tracks when you login":http://rousette.org.uk/projects/article/26/starting-tracks-at-login-with-mac-os-x-tiger on Mac OS X Tiger, and has produced a .plist file which works on its own, without the need for a separate shell script file.
 

You can download the single .plist file "here":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/files/single_startup_item_for_tracks.zip. Edit the file to put the full path to Tracks on your system under the 'WorkingDirectory' item, and also edit the port number if you want to run Tracks on a port other than 3000. Then save the file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, making the LaunchAgents directory if it doesn't yet exist. That's all there is to it! When you next login, Tracks will start automatically. If you want to start Tracks manually, use the following command in Terminal:

<pre>
<code>
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rousette.tracks.plist
</code>
</pre>

The same command with 'unload' substituted for 'load' stops Tracks. Thanks to Jeroen for some very neat work!
