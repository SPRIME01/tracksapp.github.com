With "revision 82":http://dev.rousette.org.uk/changeset/82, I've finally nearly finished the conversion of Tracks to use Ajax for creating, updating, deleting and marking actions done. I thought I'd put a couple of little movies up as a teaser.

The first shows me "editing the list of projects":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/images/Editing_projects.mov [1 MB], and the second shows me "adding and editing":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/images/Adding_to_project.mov actions in a project [2 MB].

It's still a bit rough around the edges; actions don't sort properly, nor does the badge with the count of actions update until you refresh, and I haven't quite sorted out the tab index on Safari. However, generally it's coming along quite nicely.
