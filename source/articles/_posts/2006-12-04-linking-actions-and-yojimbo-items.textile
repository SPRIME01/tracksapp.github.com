If, like me, you have the snippet manager "Yojimbo":http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml, you might be interested in a way to link actions to Yojimbo items. I often use this if I want to make extensive notes on an action, or if I want to update those notes frequently. It's also handy if you want to keep login details close at hand for an action, but you don't want to store passwords in plain text in Tracks.

It's very easy. In Yojimbo, select the item you want to link, then go to Edit > Copy Item Link. Then switch to Tracks and click the edit button for the action you're interested in. Paste the link you copied into the notes box, wrapped as a Textile link, like so (note that I've added spaces around the colon so that it renders properly on the page):

<pre>
<code>
"Yojimbo item" : x-yojimbo-item://A8A40A39-blah-blah
</code>
</pre>

When you update the action and open the notes field, you'll find a clickable link that will open your Yojimbo item. It's the kind of thing that's crying out for an Applescript or a Quicksilver script to automate it, but it's easy enough to do manually.
