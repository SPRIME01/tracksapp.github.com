If you'd like to have a globally-accessible installation of Tracks, which you could access from any computer on the internet, but you either don't have a web server, web host, or don't want the hassle of installing it yourself, you could try "Morph eXchange":http://www.morphexchange.com/. The Morph Application Platform allows you to run certain Ruby on Rails applications as services. They have some services which require a paid subscription, but their Tracks service is free to use. All you need to do is go to the "homepage":http://www.morphexchange.com/, signup for an account, then under subscriptions you will see Tracks listed. Click subscribe, and you can launch Tracks and enter your data.
